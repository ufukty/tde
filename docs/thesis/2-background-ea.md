# Background - Concepts and terms (EA-related topics)

## Evolutionary Algorithms and Genetic Programming

Developer doesn't need to know form of solution prior to development, being able to define the problem and test cases the solution should pass and fail is enough to start evolution.

## Liability and responsibility in Software Development

Products creates responsibility and liability on producer and seller. Liability usually comes from law and contracts; and customer expectations raised by market players.

Software is frequently developed as a commercial product that solves a social (or derived) problem and creates responsibility and liability on the seller company. Responsibility comes from the need to maintain company reputation in target consumer demographic and the liability comes from promises that company explicitly gave to customers as compliences to certain standards or the requirement of complying with the law.

## Meaning of "production-ready"

Just like workers of companies' other product departments, software developers should be able to inspect the prior work as the team makes progress in development to spot unfitting progress to everchanging requirements.

The aim is to present the Genetic Programming within a tool to software developers for helping them to build their commercial purposed software. The tool eventually should have features like familiarity, easy-to-learn

Most of the companies develop CRUD programs. That is a software runs on a computer accessible to clients. Exposes an stable interface consists by serial of endpoints each creates/reads/updates/deletes a resource. Resources are abstract objects, meaningful for the domain: like users, posts, photos for a social media platform; or employees, customers, e-mails, calls for a customer relation management software. Developer teams from variety of companies operates on different sector, or industries; it is safe to say that most of the teams specialized on developing CRUD programs and their skill-sets are shaped around the requirements of developing CRUD programs.

CI/CD is trending topic for nearly 20 years. That is automating the cycle of integration and deployment which is expected to be a loop because of everchanging set of requirements and priorities that are faced by organizations produce software, in addition to a work force that consists by employees don't stay forever on same company and have different degrees of experiences on the field. Steps of CI/CD are mainly considered as code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor and plan (for next round).

Familiarity: Most of the devs are experienced in building CRUD applications and their skill set don't cover the Genetic Programming or another EA variation. In order to enable those developers leveraging from advantages of GP, the method should be delivered as a tool that abstracts the internal mechanisms of evolution and only presents controls and output that they need.

For the sake of our will to make Genetic Programming widely used method for generating computer programs it is necessary to make sure a regular dev team of a standard organization that is hired for developing CRUD programs with popular programming languages of domain (eg. Java, C#, Go) should be able to
