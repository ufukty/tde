          Combining Genetic Programming with Test Driven Development 
                  to assist software developers in creating and 
                        maintaining production-ready code 




* Liability and responsibility in Software Development

  Software is frequently developed as a commercial product that solves a social 
(or derived) problem and creates responsibility and liability on the seller 
company. Responsibility comes from the need to maintain company reputation in 
target consumer demographic and the liability comes from promises that company 
explicitly gave to customers as compliences to certain standards or the requirement 
of complying with the law.

* Meaning of production-ready

Just like any company workers of other departments, software developers should be 
able to inspect the software as the team makes progress in development to spot 





* Changing requirements of projects


* Work force circulation


* Test driven development


* Evolutionary Algorithms and Genetic Programming
- Developer doesn't need to know form of solution prior to development, being able to define the problem and test cases the solution should pass and fail is enough to start evolution.
