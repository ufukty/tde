  Use tde to produce implementation in Go that complies a test.

  Usage:

      tde <command> [arguments]

  Commands:

      login         Required on first run. Asks username and pass.
      logout        Deletes session on this device.
      info          Session info and credits remaining.
    
      upload        Upload go module as an archive to tde servers.
      produce       Starts evolution process and downloads results to local.
      
      list-test     Lists all tests found in the module and files have them.
      list-upload   Lists IDs of previous uploads.
      list-produce  Lists IDs of previous runs of produce.

  Use "tde help <command>" for more information about a command and its 
  arguments.

upload: |
  Uploads whole go module as an archive to tde servers on first run. Subsequent 
  runs will only re-upload changed files.

  Usage:

      tde upload [ arguments ]

  Arguments:

      -e, -exclude-dir (Optional)
          Defaults to exclude ".git" directory. To reduce network usage it is
          best to exclude every directory that its absence won't lead to any
          compile error of target package. Multiple directories can be specified
          individually.

produce: |
  Starts the evolution process, iterates specified generations, downloads 
  results, overwrites into working directory.

  Needs the current go module already uploaded. See: "tde help upload"

  Usage:

      tde produce [ arguments ] <TDE_TestName>

  Arguments:

    Process-related:
            
      -timeout (Required) (Default=10)
          Minutes to wait before terminate request.

      -runner (Optional)
          Specify a IP:Port to use custom runners. See 
          "https://tde.io/docs/runner"

      -c, -continue (Optional)
          When absent, evolution will start from the latest saved state of files
          in local.
          When a UUID of previous evolution process has given, temporarily saved 
          information such as breeds, historical bests will be used. 
          Negative values can be given to automatically continue to last or 
          older evolutions: such as -1 for last, -10 for 10 previous start.

    Evolution-related:

      -model (Required) (Default=0.1)
          Model's version number. Currently, only option is 0.1

      -ratios (Required) (Default=10/1)
          Ratios of genetic operations: mutation, cross-over. Will be used to 
          calculate probabilities of those operations.

      -population (Required) (Default=10000)
          Number of candidates generated at start and tested at each generation.
          Higher values will consume more credits and will help to test more 
          variation of each possibility.

      -iterate (Required) (Default=10)
          Number of generations to iterate in single run.
      
      -size (Required) (Default=1000)
          Size limit for any candidate in bytes.

      -p, -package (Optional)
          Allows evolver server to include import statements and type/func usage
          from specified package. Multiple entries can be given individually. 
          Runners may have limitation on which packages can be used.
