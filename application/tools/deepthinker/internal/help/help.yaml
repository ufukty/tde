      upload        Upload go module as an archive to deepthinker.app servers.
      produce       Starts evolution process and downloads results to local.
      
      list-test     Lists all tests found in the module and files have them.
      list-upload   Lists IDs of previous uploads.
      list-produce  Lists IDs of previous runs of produce.

  Use "deepthinker help <command>" for more information about a command and its

upload: |
  Uploads whole go module as an archive to deepthinker.app servers on first run. 
  One upload can be used for starting many ESs (Evolution Sessions).

  Usage:

      deepthinker upload [ arguments ]

  Arguments:

      -e, -exclude-dir (Optional)
          To reduce network usage and avoid exceeding limits, exclude every
          directory that its absence won't lead to any compile error of target 
          package. Multiple directories can be specified individually.
          Directories ".git", "build", "docs", ".vscode", "vendor" are excluded 
          by default.

      -i, -include-ext (Optional)
          Specify additional file extensions to include in archive. 
          Multiple extensions can be specified individually.
          "go", "mod" and "sum" are preselected. Don't start with a dot 
          (like .go)

      -only-archive (Optional)
          Only archive the module. Abort before starting to upload.

      --output <path> (Optional)
          Only effective when it is used with -only-archive flag. Append the 
          target path after flag.

      -v (Optional)
          Verbose logging for error detection purposes.

produce: |
  Starts the evolution process, iterates specified generations, downloads 
  results, overwrites into working directory.

  Needs the current go module already uploaded. See: "deepthinker help upload"

  Usage:

      deepthinker produce [ arguments ] <TDE_TestName>

  Arguments:

    Process-related:
            
      -timeout (Required) (Default=10)
          Minutes to wait before terminate request.

      -runner (Optional)
          Specify a IP:Port to use custom runners. See 
          "https://deepthinker.io/docs/runner"

      -c, -continue (Optional)
          When absent, evolution will start from the latest saved state of files
          in local.
          When a UUID of previous evolution process has given, temporarily saved 
          information such as breeds, historical bests will be used. 
          Negative values can be given to automatically continue to last or 
          older evolutions: such as -1 for last, -10 for 10 previous start.

    Evolution-related:

      -model (Required) (Default=0.1)
          Model's version number. Currently, only option is 0.1

      -ratios (Required) (Default=10/1)
          Ratios of genetic operations: mutation, cross-over. Will be used to 
          calculate probabilities of those operations.

      -population (Required) (Default=10000)
          Number of subjects generated at start and tested at each generation.
          Higher values will consume more credits and will help to test more 
          variation of each possibility.

      -iterate (Required) (Default=10)
          Number of generations to iterate in single run.
      
      -size (Required) (Default=1000)
          Size limit for any subject in bytes.

      -p, -package (Optional)
          Allows evolver server to include import statements and type/func usage
          from specified package. Multiple entries can be given individually. 
          Runners may have limitation on which packages can be used.
